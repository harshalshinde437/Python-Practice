This is another way of creating a file..
this is not a standerd way, but we can try this..
'%%writefile' is a command which help to create a file,
if file is not exist, it will create a new file as given name,
and if file is avaliable, it will overwrite this file..
# this will try to create the file using magic cell of jupyter notebook.
# Magic cells are avaliable for jupyter notebook, 
# you can't create file like this using any other IDE
